# Orthogonal and Special Orthogonal Groups in Lean Theorem Prover

This undergraduate research project, conducted in the Spring 2023 semester at Temple University, formalizes the orthogonal and special orthogonal groups in Lean theorem prover. The project includes the following files:

* Orthogonal and Special Orthogonal Groups.docx : This document provides an explanation of the code in the other files.

* orthogonal_group.lean : This file defines the orthogonal group, its properties, and related theorems.

* orth_to_dihedral.lean : This file provides a proof for a group homomorphism from the orthogonal group to the dihedral group.

* special_orthogonal_group.lean : This file defines the special orthogonal group, its properties, and related theorems.

* auxiliary_theorems.lean : This file includes two-by-two matrices that represent rotations and reflections, which are used in the orthogonal and special orthogonal groups.
